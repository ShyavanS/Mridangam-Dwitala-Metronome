# Mridangam-Dwitala-Metronome
A metronome made to synchronise two different beat cycles together and keep you in time with both.

This metronome was made to help in putting Dwitala or two beat cycles at the same time for reciting Mridangam Konnakol. This helps you get in time with both beat cycles and remain in time and get a better understanding of how the beats land.
